##### Controls Firefox's built-in Session Restore, Session Manager and Crash Recovery features

<br />

<Image class="help-img" src={sessionStartexit} alt="image" />

- Use Firefox's built-in Session Restore Feature - when checked, Firefox's Session Restore feature
  will be in effect
- **_Enable Session Manager_**
- **_Enable Crash Recovery_**

:::note[no-title]
**Note**

Sessions are stored in the <b>session.rdf</b> file in [your profile][kbProfile] folder. A backup of
this file is stored in the <b>sessionbackups</b> folder in [your profile][kbProfile] folder. If your
session becomes corrupt and you are unable to restore that session, copy one of the backup files
(tabmix_sessions-yyyy-mm-dd.rdf) from the backup folder to [your profile][kbProfile] folder, rename
the file to <b>session.rdf</b>.
:::

:::note[no-title]
For a full range of sessions managing features, you can use
[Session Manager extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/session-manager/) which
is created specifically for that purpose.<br /> When Session Manager extension is installed, Tab Mix
Plus turns its own session manager off. Your existing sessions will be converted to SM format. This
two extensions work well together without any known problems.

**IMPORTANT!** If you uninstall or disable Session Manager extension, Tab Mix Plus will revert back
to its file which will not have the sessions saved with Session Manager extension.
