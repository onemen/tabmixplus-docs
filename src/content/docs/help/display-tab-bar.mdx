###### Show on Tab Bar

- **_New Tab Button_** (select one) - the new tab button will be displayed on the tab bar at the
  specified location

  - Left side
  - Right side
  - **_After last tab_**

  :::tip[no-title]
  When using tab groups in multi-row mode, the button will automatically move to the right side since placing it after the tabs can lead to repeated flickering when users add/remove groups or tabs.
  :::

  :::note[no-title]
  The New Tab button can be dragged out of the Customize Toolbar window and placed on any toolbar.
  But in order to be able to use its placement option in Tab Mix Plus (left/right/after last tab),
  it needs to be placed on the tabbar. <br /> If you don't see the New Tab button in the Customize
  window, check your toolbars to see if its already there and drag it to the tabbar.

  Click on **_Customize..._** and drag the New Tab Button to the tabbar.

  - Theme background style <Badge text="New in version 1.28" variant="note" /><br/>
    When using a theme with a background image, the image height may not match the tab-bar height, especially with multi-row tabs. This option allows you to adjust the background style to fit the tab-bar height. You can choose from the following options:
    - Repeat: Repeats the background image to cover the entire tab bar height.
    - Cover: Scales the background image to cover the entire tab bar height, while maintaining its aspect ratio.
    - Theme Default: Uses the default background style set by the theme.

- Max number of rows to display - default 3 - for Multi-row option

  :::note[no-title]
  The number controls the max number of rows to display - When tabs are spread on more rows than the
