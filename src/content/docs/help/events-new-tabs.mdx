###### Other Tabs

- Open other tabs next to current one

  - Only if related to current tab
  - Change opening order - tabs will open to the right of the most recently opened. Please refer to
    the example below.

    :::note[no-title]

    <span>
      <u>Example of changing opening order</u>
    </span>
    `[a][b][c]` are the current opened tabs with `[a]` being the current tab. <br /> `[1][2][3]` are
    the new tabs opened in that order. <br /> `[a][b][c][1][2][3]` -&gt; `[a][3][2][1][b][c]`, this
    is how tabs open without _Change opening order_. <br /> `[a][b][c][1][2][3]` -&gt;
    `[a][1][2][3][b][c]`, this is how tabs open with _Change opening order_ option checked. :::

- **_Open duplicated tabs next to original_**

- Move tab from 'Switch to tab' next to current one

  :::note[no-title]
  When using 'Switch to tab' from address bar popup, move the tab you switching to next to the
  currently selected tab. <br /> This only applied when the tab you switching to is in the same
  window. <Image src={switchToTab} alt="image" />

###### Groups of bookmarks/history

:::note[no-title]
When opening many tabs from bookmarks group or history loading time for all tabs can be long,
especially when multi-process (aka E10s, [Electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis)) is
enabled. <br /> It is recommended to enable these options when opening many tabs.
:::

- Load tabs progressively - load tabs no more than 3 tabs at a time.

- Don't load tabs until selected - all background tabs remain unloaded until selected.

:::note[no-title]
For both options you can set the amount of tabs that serve as a threshold to enable the option.
:::

###### Lock tabs

- Lock New tabs
- Lock App tabs
- **_Apply changes to open tabs_**

:::note[no-title]
You can set Tab Mix Plus to lock every new tab and every new App tab. If "Apply changes to open
tabs" is enabled, any change to <b>Lock New tabs</b> or

<b>Lock Apps tabs</b> preferences change the lock status of open tabs accordingly. :::
