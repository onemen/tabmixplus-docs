<Update />

## Always up-to-date

I am maintaining **Tab Mix Plus** since Firefox 1.0.<br />
I continue to improve **Tab Mix Plus** by fixing bugs and compatibility problems with other
extensions and themes, as well as other Firefox's based browsers like
[Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/), [Floorp](https://floorp.app/) and
[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/).
