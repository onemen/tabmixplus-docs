:::note
Since Firefox removed the internal component that loads _legacy_ extension, in order to install
**Tab Mix Plus**, or any other _legacy_ extension, you have to install 3rd party helper scripts.
:::

## Install Firefox Scripts

Please follow the instructions below step-by-step to install the scripts. The extension will not
work if you install any files in the wrong location.

### Install config script

Open `about:support` and locate the path to your **Application Binary** and **Profile Folder**<br/>

:::note
`Application Binary` folder Is `Firefox root directory` (the folder that contains `firefox.exe`).
for clarity, this text uses the terms **Firefox root directory**<br /> `Profile Folder` is where
Firefox stores your bookmarks, passwords and other user data. You can find more information about it
in [this article](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data)

Copy [configuration files](https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus/files/14075743/fx-folder.zip) to
your **Firefox root directory**.<br/> `fx-folder.zip` files are packed with paths used by Firefox
for `Windows`, `Linux` and `macOS` users should follow the instructions below. the `zip` file
contain the following files:

- `config.js` - This file should be copied to the directory that contains `firefox.exe`, referred to
  as `PATH TO FIREFOX.EXE`.
- `config-prefs.js` - This file should be copied to `[PATH TO FIREFOX.EXE]/defaults/pref`.

        </div>

### Install utils

Remember, the **utils** script needs to be installed separately in each profile where you want to
use **Tab Mix Plus**. This differs from the main `config` script, which only requires installation
once in your Firefox root directory (containing firefox.exe). The reason for this distinction is
that each profile maintains its own settings and data, and the utils script plays a vital role in
ensuring **Tab Mix Plus** works seamlessly within each individual profile.

<Steps>

1. Locate your **Profile Folder** as discrived in the previous step, create `chrome` folder in it, if one does not exist.

2. Create `chrome` folder in your **Profile Folder** (if one does not exist).

3. Extract
   [utils](https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus/files/14075742/utils_extensions_and_scripts.zip)
   folder inside the `chrome` folder, the result should be `[PROFILE_NAME]/chrome/utils`, all the
   files should be in the `utils` folder (see the screenshot below).<br />
   Make sure all the files you see in the screenshot below are in the `utils` folder and that `utils` folder is inside `chrome` folder.

4. Open **about\:support** page and click `Clear startup cache…` to force Firefox to load the
   installed scripts on the next startup.

</Steps>
